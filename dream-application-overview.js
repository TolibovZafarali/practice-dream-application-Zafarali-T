// 1. Getting and Time Management.

// - To build Alpha Pi - AI Accountant successfully, I will need a system to manage development milestones, business requirements, and personal commitments.
// I will need some strategies for staying organized, such as using a calendar system, to schedule major development phases, testing periods, and business planning meetings.
// Keep a to-do list, to break tasks into smaller steps - such as integrating banking APIs, refining AI-generated insights, and developing mobile-friendly features - to track progress efficiently.

// - Managing time.
// Balancing AI development with other responsibilites requires smart time management. 
// If I challenge feelings like I'm always working on this app, but not making progress, I should priorize tasks by focusing on high-impact features first. (e.g., AI recommendations, bank integrations).
// Breaking tasks into manageable chunks by dividing development into phases, setting clear goals with deadlines for specific milestones, like launching a prototype.
// Using Pomodoro Technique, to block my time by dedicating focused work periods to specific tasks. These structured approaches will help us stau on track.

// 2. Values, Data Types, and Operations.

// Store financial data using numbers, booleans (e.g., "isInvoicePaid = true"), and strings (e.g., "expenseCategory = 'Marketing'").
// Perform operations like calculating total revenue, net profit, or tax liabilities.

// Example Code:

let revenue = 50000; // Number data type
let expenses = 20000; // Number data type
let netProfit = revenue - expenses; // Operation: Subtracting expenses from revenue
console.log("Net Profit:", netProfit);

// 3. The Growth Mindset.

// Effort: Commit to continuous learning and improvement.
// Feedback: Use feedback from users to improve. For example, we will need to actively seek feedback from small business owners, accountants, and beta testers to refine Alpha-Pi.
// After launching the first version, we could receive feedback like "The dashboard is too complicated." or "I need automated reports that I can generate with one click." 
// By listening to our users' concerns and continuously improving the interface and functionality based on their feedback, Alpha-Pi will better meet their needs.

// 4. Stringing Characters Together.

// - This lesson would help a lot to generate dynamic invoice details by concatenating strings.

// Example Code:

let clientName = "Alvyn Salazar";
let invoiceAmount = 1500;
let invoiceMessage = `Invoice for ${clientName}: $${invoiceAmount}`;
console.log(invoiceMessage);

// 5. Control Structures and Logic.

// Implement conditions for overdue invoices.

// Example Code:

let invoiceDueDate = "2025-04-01";
let today = "2025-04-05";

if (today > invoiceDueDate) {
    console.log("Invoice is overdue! Send a reminder.");
} else {
    console.log("Invoice is still within the due date.");
}

// 6. Working with Loops.

// Working with loops would help us automate processing multiple transactions at once.

// Example Code:

let transactions = [500, -200, 1000, -50]; // Positive for income, negative for expenses
let balance = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < transactions.length; i++) {
    balance += transactions[i]; // Add each transaction to balance
}

console.log("Final Balance:", balance);

// 7. Building Arrays.

// Here, creating and building arrays dynamically would be greatly benefial to store financial records efficiently.

// Example Code:

let expenseCategories = ["Rent", "Utilities", "Salaries", "Marketing"];
console.log("Expense Categories:", expenseCategories);

// 8. Using Arrays.

// Using arrays in the development of Alpha-Pi would be highly beneficial for managing, organizing, and manipulating data efficiently.

// Example Code:

let expenseAmounts = [1200, 300, 2500, 700];
let totalExpenses = expenseAmounts.reduce((acc, amount) => acc + amount, 0);
console.log("Total Expenses:", totalExpenses);
